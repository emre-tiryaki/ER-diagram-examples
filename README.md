# ER-diagram-examples

This repository is dedicated to storing various database ER (Entity Relationship) diagrams that I create. My main goal is to improve my skills in database design by drawing ER diagrams for hypothetical projects, not for any specific existing project.

## About

- This repo will not contain any code; only diagrams and related documentation.
- I am doing this purely for learning purposes and to become better at designing databases.
- Over time, I plan to expand the collection with more diagrams and examples.

## Contribution & Ideas

- All my planned diagrams and ideas are opened as issues.
- If you have suggestions, requests, or want to share your own ideas, feel free to open an issue.
- Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

## Contact

If you want to discuss or suggest anything, just open an issue. Let's learn and improve together!
